* **01_non_linear_fit.py**: Relatively simple example with a non-linear model function.
* **02_double_slit.py**: More complicated example with a non-linear model function.
* **03_x_errors.py**: Linear fit that becomes non-linear due to *x* errors.

Relevant case studies:

* **extremely_nonlinear_fit.py**: Profile of a simple fit with *x* errors so large it might not
  converge.
