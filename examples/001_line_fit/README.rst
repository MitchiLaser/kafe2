Performe fits using the methods kafe2.xy_fit and kafe2.plot (so-called "wrapper functions").
These methods providepre-configured pipelines for fitting models to xy data and plotting
the results.

* **line_fit.py**: Simple example of fitting a line to data with both *x* and *y* errors.

Internally, the wrapper functions use objects (in the programming sense), i.e. instances
of Python classes. An implementation with the more general, but also much more flexible
and powerful object-oriented interface of the same problem as above is shown in the example

* **003_profiling/00_object_oriented_programming.py**
