<h2 id="kafe2"><strong><em>kafe2</em></strong></h2>
<p>  is an open-source <i>Python</i> package designed to provide a flexible interface for the estimation of model parameters from measured data. It is the spiritual successor to the original <a href="https://github.com/dsavoiu/kafe"><em>kafe</em></a> package.</p>
<p><em>kafe2</em> offers support for <strong>several types of input data</strong> like series of indexed measurements, <em>x-y</em> value pairs, and histogram data. Different types of uncertainties are taken into account, like <strong>statistical and relative or absolute systematic uncertainties</strong>. Arbitrarily complex parametric models to describe the data can be provided as <em>Python</em> code.</p>
<p>Fitting procedures in <em>kafe2</em> are based on <strong>negative log-likelihood cost-functions</strong> (<em>nlL</em>). As the default and for consistency with other tools, parameter uncertainties are determined via the Cramér-Rao-Frechét bound, i.e. based on the 2nd derivatives of the <em>nlL</em> function with respect to the parameters. Optionally, one and two-dimensional profile-likelihood scans can be performed, which provide asymmetric confidence intervals for the parameter values.</p>
<p>The graphical result of a fit of two models to data with <em>kafe2</em> is shown in the figures below.</p>

<p>Handling different kinds of uncertainties is one of the unique features of the <em>kafe2</em> package. Data points are affected by uncertainties in both the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> directions, which may be absolute, relative, uncorrelated or correlated among all data points or among groups of data points. These different kinds of uncertainties are taken into account by construction of the overall covariance matrix in each step of the numerical optimization. This detail of the numerical procedure is particularly important for relative uncertainties and for uncertainties in the <em>x</em>-direction, which depend on the parameter-dependent model values rather than on the observed values in data. Although computationally expensive, this method avoids biases in the predicted parameters and leads to an optimal statistical coverage of the confidence intervals derived for the parameter estimates.</p>
<p>The <em>kafe2</em> package comes with extensive documentation for beginners, advanced users and programmers wanting to include powerful fits in their own projects. A large number of examples explain practical applications and may serve as simple function wrappers for own projects. The stand-alone program <em>kafe2go</em> permits data-driven fits without the need for the user providing <em>Python</em> code; the input format describing data and their uncertainties as well as meta-data and the fit model is based on the very light-weight human-readable data description language <em>yaml</em>.</p>
