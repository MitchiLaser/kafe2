<h2 id="kafe2"><strong><em>kafe2</em></strong></h2>
<p>  is an open-source <i>Python</i> package designed to provide a flexible interface for the estimation of model parameters from measured data. It is the spiritual successor to the original <a href="https://github.com/dsavoiu/kafe"><em>kafe</em></a> package.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Python</em> versions 3.8+ are supported.</li>
<li>Numerical aspects are handled by the scientific <em>Python</em> stack (<em>NumPy</em>, <em>SciPy</em>, …).</li>
<li>Visualizations of the data, the estimated model and of parameter confidence regions are provided by <em>matplotlib</em>.</li>
<li>High-dimensional numerical optimization and uncertainty analysis rely on the packages <em>scipy.optimize</em> or <em>iminuit</em> (based on the Minuit2 C++ package developed and maintained at CERN).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fitting-with-kafe2-in-a-nutshell">Fitting with <em>kafe2</em> in a nutshell</h2>
<p><em>kafe2</em> offers support for several types of data (including series of indexed measurements, <em>x-y</em> value pairs, and histogram data) and uncertainty models, as well as arbitrarily complex parametric models implemented in <em>Python</em>.</p>
<p>Fitting procedures in <em>kafe2</em> are based on negative log-likelihood cost-functions (<em>nlL</em>). As the default and for consistency with other tools, uncertainties are determined via the Cramér-Rao-Frechét bound, i.e. based on the 2nd derivatives of the <em>nlL</em> function with respect to the parameters. Optionally, one and two-dimensional scans of the profile likelihood can be performed, which provide asymmetric confidence intervals for the parameter values, as is shown in the example below.</p>

<p>Handling different kinds of uncertainties is one of the unique features of the <em>kafe2</em> package. Data points are affected by uncertainties in the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> directions, which may be absolute, relative, uncorrelated or correlated among all or groups of data points. These different kinds of uncertainties are taken into account by construction of the overall covariance matrix in each step of the numerical optimization. This is particularly important for relative uncertainties and for uncertainties in the <em>x</em>-direction, which depend on the model values rather than on the observed values in data. This procedure is numerically expensive, but avoids biases in the predicted parameters and leads to an optimal statistical coverage of the confidence intervals derived for the parameter estimates.</p>
